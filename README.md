   You might need to use ```sudo npm install -g bower``` due to certain restrictions on your system.
3. Go to project directory and install project components using command:

   ```bower install```

4. That's it. You're done. Explore the project.

5. To serve the app locally, you need to install all devDependencies using ```npm install``` command. This will install all grunt plugins and other dependencies.

6. Now, you can type ```grunt serve``` to serve your application.
